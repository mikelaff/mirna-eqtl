Association results are from primary, secondary, and tertiary analyses. No significant results were
found in the quarternary analysis and have been left out of these summary statistics.

Columns:
SNP: unique variant identifier, combination of chromosome, base-pair position, and variants
BETA: eQTL association effect size after fitting to the linear mixed model using EMMAX
P: nominal p-value on linear mixed model fitting using EMMAX
UniName: combination of primary-miRNA and mature-miRNA name to create a unique identifier for miRNAs with the same sequence that originate from multiple genomic loci
CHR: variant chromosome
BP.hg38: variant base-pair position using hg38
REF: reference allele using hg38
ALT: alternate allele using hg38
ALT_CTS: alternate allele counts. Summed allelic dosage across all samples in the analysis
OBS_CT: total allele counts. Number of samples x2
EFFECT.ALLELE: effect allele used in the linear mixed model association by EMMAX
A1: A1 allele as defined by plink1.9, usually minor allele
A2: A2 allele as defined by plink1.9, usually major allele
A1.HOM.count: number of homozygous A1 samples
HET.count: number of heterozygous samples
A2.HOM.count: number of homozygous A2 samples
degree: degree to which the association is conditionally-independent
