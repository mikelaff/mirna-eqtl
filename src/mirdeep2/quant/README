Small pipeline for quantification of known and novel mirnas using miRDeep2
Moving, combining, renaming, and cutting of adapters from fastq files was
done with already established scripts, see /proj/steinlab/projects/miRNA-eQTL-project/mirna-eqtl/src/mapping:
00_cp_fastq.sh
01_cat_fastq.sh
02_trim_adapters.sh

Files input to mirdeep mapper need to be unzipped.

in 03_mirdeep2_quant_known_and_novel.sh the gzipped adapter trimmed file
are unzipped and fed into the mapper.pl
This run of mapper.pl will only collapse reads and process into a .fa file.
After mapper, quantifier.pl is run to map/quantify reads to known and novel
mirnas and their precorsors (hairpins).

For 04_mirdeep2_quant_mirbaseV22.sh I used the collapsed reads generated
in 03_ by the mapper.pl script saving the steps of unzipping and collapsing reads.

At the end, cleaned up files that are large:
removed *.collapsed.fa, *.trimmed.fastq and *trimmed.fastq.gz
