Preparation of genotype files for imputation was done within the /results/genotypes/imputation_*
directories. See READMEs within those directories for information on how .vcf files were prepared
for the Michigan Imputation Server.

Post imputation, download, and unzip, the .vcf files were processed with scripts found in this
directory.
