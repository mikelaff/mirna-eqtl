These scripts were used to create TOPMed imputed genotype files which are prefiltered for mirQTLor samples and filtered for minor allele frequency and homozygous minor/het counts.

mirQTLor samples are similar to mirQTL samples but outliers have been removed (or). Outliers are determined from batch corrected PCA of mirQTL samples.

Scripts filtering of vcf files and converting to plink files (scipts 01 and 02 of mirQTL_imputed_genotyeps) are the same and the data produced by those scripts will be used as the starting point for sample filtering in script 03.
