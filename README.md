## Code

### Local-miRNA-eQTLs

Primary local-miRNA-eQTLs were found using EMMAX using scripts [here](https://github.com/mikelaff/mirna-eqtl-manuscript/tree/main/src/emmax/final_pipeline). Secondary and greater degree eQTLs were found by repeating the pipeline at various significance thresholds using scripts [here](https://github.com/mikelaff/mirna-eqtl-manuscript/tree/main/src/conditionally_independent_eqtls).
